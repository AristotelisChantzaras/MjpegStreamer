# MjpegStreamer
MJPEG Streaming library
* UWP - Camera capture broadcasting demo
* WinForms - Screencasting demo

notes:
* test with Firefox and Chrome
* due to network isolation in UWP, browser (MJPEG client) has to be run on different machine than the UWP streaming app (MJPEG server). No such issue in the WinForms version
